- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @bowandcaro 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things so I'll keep it to three: psychology (personality, productivity, how tech is changing the way we work and connect, etc), Geosciences (all things earth and space and sustainability), and food (love to eat, experiment with cooking and finding ways to eat healthier and not spend too much time in the kitchen)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently expanding my skills in learning python, SQL, and Tableau.. I LOVE to learn!
